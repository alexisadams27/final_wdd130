    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>I decided on the content for my page because I saw a need for it in my life. I would have loved a wedding checklist website to help me wedding plan. The images were chosen to fit the aesthetic I was going for. Communication with my developer was very smooth, we used both email and text to communicate about the site plan, steps throughout the process, and to see the finished project. The developer did meet all my expectations, however I feel that there was a real style difference. Next time, I would be more involved in the process and monitor more closely to make sure my vision is being followed. I found that the elements were completed but I would call the site… not very good looking. </p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>As the lead developer, I communicated with my development team right away. I reached out to them with our client’s site plan and got their usernames. Through a group chat they had all the information I had to be successful. I also communicated with our client through text and communication-wise, not problems. He was concerned that the child pages were not being completed. Publishing the site to GitHub went very smooth thanks to Bro Alvey showing us the steps. We easily shared the link with Cody and he really liked the site. My experience with GitHub was very smooth and no problems arose. </p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>The class was set up for the team lead to reach out to us (junior developers). One of the leads reached out to me, used my phone number, and stayed in touch with me throughout class as well. The other team lead did not reach out to me and was not present in class so there was no way to complete the project for him. Despite an email on my part, there was no response and therefore no way to continue. This was the only issue during the whole project for me. However, with the present team lead, I was sent the site plan, added to the GitHub, and he guided me to know which child page I would be working on. Expectations were very clear. There were no problems with GitHub. </p>

    <h2>General Expereince Report</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part of this project for me was to create someone else’s dream site with my beginner skills. When I was completing my own projects, I was flexible but when working for a client you must complete it to their expectations. No loopholes. For example, staggering images and text was difficult for me. But I researched and used w3schools to help me complete the html and the client wished. My favorite part was seeing my completed site and the site I completed. It is very satisfying and fulfilling to see all my skills I learned this semester come to life. I would not do anything differently, I feel that my work and communication was as much as I possibly could on my own. After this experience, I feel confident working in a real-world project, this is a very helpful project. It taught me coding skills, communication, life-lessons, work-ethic, and how to combine all that I have learned and make someone else happy. </p>
